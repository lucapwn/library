## About

The [Library](https://github.com/lucapwn/library) is a book registration site developed in PHP to demonstrate the operations of a CRUD with a connection to the MySQL database.

## Support

This site is available for all browsers.

## Running

With [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html) or any other server running Apache and MySQL, start the server and run the SQL query from the [```library.sql```](https://github.com/lucapwn/library/blob/main/library.sql) file to create the database and table.

Then use the **admin** user and **admin** password to access the site.
